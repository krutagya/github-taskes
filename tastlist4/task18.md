# **Task 18: Make Changes and Commit :**
## **1. Create a new branch for your changes :**
git checkout -b fix-typo
```bash
Ans:
1. The command git checkout -b fix-typo is used to create a new branch named fix-typo and switch to it immediately.
```
## **2. Make changes to the code (e.g., fix a typo in README.md), stage, and commit them :**
git add README.md
git commit -m "Fixed typo in README.md"
```bash
Ans:
1. git add README.md:
This stages the changes made to the README.md file. It tells Git to include this file in the next commit.

2. git commit -m "Fixed typo in README.md":
This creates a commit with the staged changes. The -m flag allows you to include a commit message directly, in this case, "Fixed typo in README.md."
```
