## **1.Unstage a staged file:**
git reset file1.txt
```bash
Ans:
1. jatan said that this will work as if we added file1.txt then it has been gone to the stagging area if we have to pull it that file from staging area then we will use reset
```

## **2.Discard uncommitted changes:**
git checkout -- file1.txt
```bash
Ans:
1. i will take a example that if one file is commited and another file is in the stagging area and another is in the local if we use this code then the update which is on  the local and not added that willl delete fromm the local it cannot delete the staging area modificatio and commit one
```
